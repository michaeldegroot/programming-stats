# Developer Dashboard

A public dashboard to keep track of your coding activity.

My dashboard can be viewed [here](http://sankhs.com/devdashboard).

This uses the [Wakatime](https://wakatime.com) API. You need to install the Wakatime plugin in your text editor.

# Running

Put your Wakatime API key in the `API_KEY` file. Then run the `./dashboard.sh` command.

You can set this script as a scheduled task on your machine to update the dashboard periodically.
